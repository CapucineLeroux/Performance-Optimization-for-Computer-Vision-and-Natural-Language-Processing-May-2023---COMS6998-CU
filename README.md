# Performance Optimization for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing - Capucine Leroux (cpl2146@columbia.edu) and Austin Xiong (ax2156@columbia.edu)

The project aims at optimizing performance of two different models: the VGGNet for visual recognition, and the LSTM for sentiment analysis. You can find more details about the project in the report and the slides. 

## Content of this repository
There are two folders, one for each model. The content of each folder is explained in a dedicated README for each model.
